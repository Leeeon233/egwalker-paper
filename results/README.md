This data is all autogenerated from various scripts:

- `dtcrdt_memusage.json` comes from running `cargo run --release -p run_on_old --features memusage` in the `tools/diamond-types` folder
- `automerge_memusage.json` comes from running `cargo run --features memusage --release` in `tools/paper-benchmarks` folder
- `ot_memusage.json` comes from running `cargo run --features memusage --release` in `tools/ot-bench` folder
- `yjs_memusage.json` comes from running `node --expose-gc bench-memusage.js` in `tools/bench-yjs`.
- `js.json` comes from running `node bench-remote.js`
- `dataset_stats.json` and `dt_memusage.json` come from running `cargo run --release -p paper-stats --features memusage` in tools/diamond-types

- `timings.json` and `yjs_am_sizes.json` come from `node collect.js` in the root of this repository. Before running collect.js, you need to run some other benchmark scripts:

```
cd tools/diamond-types && ./bench.sh # benchmarks eg-walker
cd tools/diamond-types && ./bench-runonold.sh # benchmarks ref-crdt
cd tools/paper-benchmarks && ./bench.sh # benchmarks automerge and cola (unused data)
cd tools/bench-yjs && node bench-remote.js # benchmarks yjs
cd tools/ot-bench && ./bench.sh # benchmarks OT code
```
